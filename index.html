            <pre>                This is an  calculator, one with somewhat complicated buttons. 
                The main issues with this was the history array, the most complicated part of this new calculator.
                (massive blurb talking about how i eventually make the awesome history buttons)
                This calculator started out as an image map, but proved to be too disfunctional, so it was dropped instead for a table. 
                It also took a while for me to understand or get things working reason for being my own faults in letting myself get distracted.
                Even after all that, here's a slightly better calculator
