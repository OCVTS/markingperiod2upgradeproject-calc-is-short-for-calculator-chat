            <pre>                This is a  calculator, one with somewhat complicated buttons. 
                The calculator's button selection was selected through looking images of multiple
                calculators in the internet and seeing which were some fo the most common. Most of
                the functions were made by using the Math object. The table calc is made up of 
                buttons (duh) and displays some of the equation when being entered. Some of the 
                buttons have nothing they can do. There are 2 empty displays because they're for 
                future prospects.
