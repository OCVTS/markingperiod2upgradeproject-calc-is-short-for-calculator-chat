            <pre>                This is an upgraded calculator, one with somewhat more complicated buttons. 
                The main issues with this was the history array, the most complicated part of this new calculator.
                (massive blurb talking about how i eventually make the awesome history buttons)
                It was a shame that I had to abandon the image map, but it was because there was a halt in any part of it functioning. 
                It also took a while for me to understand or get things working reason for being my own faults in letting myself get distracted.
                Even after all that, here's a slightly better calculator
